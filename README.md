# No Party People
This is a space for the No Party People. We might vote for Democrats, but we aren't Democrats. This is a place for us to organize.

What we can do here is collaborate on running independent candidates to challenge weak Democrats and nutty Republicans in state legislatures and the US House. While we won't reach a majority in any governing body, the purpose is to shake things up. Make Democrats and Republicans afraid. To do that we need a lot of people get involved. 

We need laywers, a bunch of those people who went to school for poli-sci and activists. 

I don't have all of the answers, but maybe this a place for us to organize ourselves to be a bit more effective.
